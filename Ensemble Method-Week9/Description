This dataset is a collection of basic health biological signal data.
The goal is to determine the presence or absence of smoking through bio-signals.
Use any ensembled model to predict the status of the target variable "smoking".
Vary the different hyperperameters like type of estimator, number of estimators, etc. and find the best model that fits the data correctly without underfitting or overfitting.
Create one markdown cell at the end to report all your results indicating the accuracy of different models you explored.

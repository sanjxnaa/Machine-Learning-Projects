In this compettition, We are going to predict the quality of white wine based on some features. 
Train an ML model that can learn a generalized model from the given training data.
Data Set Characteristics:

Number of Attributes: 11 predictive attributes and the target variable
Attribute Information:
1 - fixed acidity
2 - volatile acidity
3 - citric acid
4 - residual sugar
5 - chlorides
6 - free sulfur dioxide
7 - total sulfur dioxide
8 - density
9 - pH
10 - sulphates
11 - alcohol
12 - Quality

Task is to do all the preprocessing needed before you train the model. To make the confusion matrix.
Create a markdown cell at the end of your notebook and tabulate all your results and observations for each and every feature selection done. We can measure the required perfomance metrics: F Score, to better your result.

Model used here to predict the wine quality is Random Forest Classifier.

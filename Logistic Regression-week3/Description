We will be using a simulated dataset containing sales of child car seats at 400 different stores.
Using the given ChildSeatSales dataset we are trying to fit Logistic regression model to predict the class to which the given Sales in a location belong to. 
Before we train the model you need to create the traget variable "Category".

Preprocessing:
Sales is a continuous valued variable. Use Sales value to add a new field by name "Category". This newly created attribute "Category" is the target variable.
  Assign Category = 1 if Sales<=5
  Category = 2 if 5 < Sales <= 10, and
  Category = 3 if Sales>10.

We are allowed to use any applicable and required pre-processing techniques.

Main goal is to analyze the problem by varying all the hyper parameters to get better performance.

Classification accuracy is used as the performance metric.

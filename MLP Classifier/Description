Using MLP(Multi-Layer Perceptron) model, We are supposed to train the MNIST digit dataset to recognize the handwritten digits. Refer to MNIST digit dataset to know more details about the dataset. 
This is experimented by changing hyperparameters like number hidden layers, number of neurons in each of the hidden layers to get better proformance. 
I got a score of 99.4% on the unseen data.

Data set comprises of measurements of geometrical properties of kernels belonging to three different varieties of wheat. 
A soft X-ray technique and GRAINS package were used to construct all seven, real-valued attributes. 
Kernels belong to three different varieties of wheat: Kama, Rosa and Canadian (Target variable).

We are expected to train an SVM(Support Vector Machine) model that can predict the Wheet kernel type. By experimenting with different Kernel functions and different values of the parameter C.
